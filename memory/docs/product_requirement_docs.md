# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Layer 7 to Apigee Migration Tool

### 1. Project Overview
**Project Name**: Layer 7 to Apigee Migration Tool  
**Project Type**: API Gateway Migration Solution  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: July 20, 2025  

### 2. Executive Summary
This project aims to build an automated migration tool that converts Layer 7 API Gateway configurations to Google Apigee, enabling seamless transition for organizations moving from Layer 7 to Apigee's enhanced feature set.

### 3. Problem Statement
**Core Problem**: Customers want to migrate from Layer 7 API Gateway to Google Apigee to leverage advanced functionality not available in Layer 7, but manual migration is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires deep expertise in both platforms.

**Pain Points**:
- Manual conversion is resource-intensive
- Risk of configuration errors during migration
- Lack of automated validation and deployment
- No automated error correction during deployment
- Time-consuming testing and validation process

### 4. Target Users
**Primary Users**: API Developers currently using Layer 7 API Gateway
**User Personas**:
- API developers with Layer 7 experience
- DevOps engineers managing API deployments
- Enterprise architects planning migration strategies
- QA engineers validating migrated APIs

**User Goals**:
- Seamless, automatic conversion from Layer 7 to Apigee
- Reduced manual effort in migration process
- Automated deployment and validation
- Self-correcting deployment errors

### 5. Key Features & Requirements

#### 5.1 Core Features
1. **Layer 7 Code Reader & Parser**
   - Accept root folder path of Layer 7 v11.1 project
   - Parse XML policies and service configurations
   - Extract folder structure, policies, and services
   - **EXCLUDED**: Certificates, persistent storages, caches, TLS settings

2. **Apigee X Code Generator**
   - Convert Layer 7 configurations to Apigee X Maven project structure
   - Generate Apigee proxy configurations following Apigee naming conventions
   - Create equivalent policies for basic authentication and routing
   - Handle simple REST APIs with single backend (no orchestration)
   - Convert unsupported features to JavaScript policies where possible

3. **MCP Server for Apigee X**
   - Generate deployable Maven project structure
   - Support single or multiple Apigee environments
   - Monitor deployment status and logs
   - Focus on code generation rather than full deployment pipeline

4. **Auto-Correction System**
   - Detect and fix syntax errors automatically
   - Handle policy conflicts by removing conflicting elements
   - Remove failing features/policies and provide detailed notifications
   - Fallback: Deploy proxy without problematic components

#### 5.2 Technical Requirements
- **Source Platform**: Layer 7 API Gateway v11.1
- **Target Platform**: Apigee X
- **Backend API**: FastAPI framework
- **MCP Server**: Python implementation
- **Input**: Layer 7 project root folder path (XML policies)
- **Output**: Deployable Apigee X Maven project
- **Scope**: Simple REST APIs with basic auth and routing only

### 6. Success Criteria
- Successfully parse Layer 7 v11.1 XML policies and folder structures
- Generate deployable Apigee X Maven projects without manual intervention
- Convert 95% of simple REST APIs with basic auth and routing
- Automatically handle syntax errors and policy conflicts
- Maintain API functionality for simple single-backend scenarios
- Provide clear notifications for removed/failed features

### 7. Assumptions & Constraints
**Assumptions**:
- Layer 7 v11.1 projects follow standard XML policy structure
- Focus on simple REST APIs only (no complex transformations)
- Single backend per API (no orchestration or side calls)
- Basic authentication patterns are standard across projects
- Apigee X environment is accessible for testing

**Constraints**:
- **EXCLUDED**: Complex transformations, orchestration, side calls
- **EXCLUDED**: Certificates, persistent storage, caches, TLS settings
- **EXCLUDED**: Complex authentication beyond basic auth
- Limited to simple routing and basic authentication policies
- Maven-only output format for Apigee X

### 8. Out of Scope (v1.0)
- Production deployment automation (only Maven project generation)
- Complex Layer 7 transformations and orchestrations
- Multi-backend routing and service orchestration
- Advanced authentication mechanisms beyond basic auth
- Certificates and TLS configuration migration
- Cache and persistent storage migration
- Bidirectional conversion (Apigee to Layer 7)
- GUI interface (API-first approach)

### 9. Dependencies
- Layer 7 Gateway documentation and samples
- Apigee documentation and APIs
- Access to both Layer 7 and Apigee environments
- Maven for Apigee project structure

### 10. Risks & Mitigation
**High Risk**: Complex Layer 7 configurations may not map directly to Apigee
**Mitigation**: Start with common patterns, build extensible conversion engine

**Medium Risk**: Apigee API changes affecting deployment
**Mitigation**: Use stable Apigee APIs, implement version checking

### 11. Next Steps
1. Detailed technical architecture design
2. Layer 7 configuration analysis and mapping
3. Apigee equivalent pattern identification
4. MVP development with basic conversion capabilities
